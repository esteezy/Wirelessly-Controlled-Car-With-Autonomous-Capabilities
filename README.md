# Wirelessly-Controlled-Car-With-Autonomous-Capabilities

Centered around a custom built PCB, housing a Texas-Instruments MSP-430, this vehicle can be wirelessly driven to your liking. Using a TCP Telnet Terminal, you can issue 
certain commands allowing the car to turn, reverse, go forward, and follow or avoid blacklines/edges.
